## 🚀 About Me  

I design and deploy end-to-end data systems that move real business metrics — not just models in notebooks.  

My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, scalable infrastructure, and product thinking**. I specialize in building production-grade pipelines, deploying APIs, and translating complex AI systems into measurable outcomes such as revenue growth, cost savings, and operational efficiency.  

I bridge technical and business teams to ensure AI initiatives deliver impact — not experimentation without execution.
